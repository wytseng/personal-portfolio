Hi👋🏻, glad that you found me here!
This website has been deployed at ➡️ [portfolio site](https://personal-portfolio-eta-beryl.vercel.app/). 

🌱 I am Stephanie. I am inspired to code simple and effective websites. I am still new in this field, but I aspire to learn and improve. 

📄 This application is a static website that serves as my personal portfolio. The entire website demonstrates my front-end coding skills. The work section also links you to some group projects I participated in, which also showcases some of my back-end coding skills. 

📧 If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out to me at wytseng113@gmail.com. Alternatively, you can fill out the contact form on the website (test out the features~)
